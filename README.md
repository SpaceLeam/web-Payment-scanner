## 🔍 Attack Vectors

### Implemented Tests

1. **Race Conditions**
   - Concurrent request flooding
   - Synchronization barrier testing
   - Multi-coupon/voucher exploitation

2. **Price Manipulation**
   - Negative pricing
   - Zero/near-zero amounts
   - Decimal precision abuse

3. **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)**
   - Cross-account resource access
   - Order ID enumeration

4. **OTP/2FA Security**
   - Rate limit bypass
   - Brute force testing

5. **Webhook/Callback Authentication**
   - Signature validation bypass
   - Replay attack testing
